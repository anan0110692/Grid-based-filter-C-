# Grid-based-filter-C++
In this project I have  implemented the grid based filter using C++ hand in hand with MATLAB engine API for graphing purpose.  

In this project we have simulated the following non linear system:

Then, we feeded the output(z) to the  filter to estimate the internal state of that system(x).
## Required  libraries: 
- MATLAB ENGINE API FOR C++
- Boost library
## How to run the code:
- Download and run the source code.
